Trees, the linux way:
  - lookups acquire rcu_read_lock
  - insertions acquire a spinlock on tree
  - deletes acquire a spinlock on tree, and also rcu synchronize before freeing
    removed item
  - modifications acquire a lock on individual item
  - scans acquire rcu_read_lock

Lists, the linux way:
  - Doesn't matter, lists are slow

Vectors, the linux way:
  - No precedent, linux uses Lists mostly.

So what to do for a tree of vectors?
  - Change to a tree of vectors-with-locks.
     - then use rcu_read_lock to scan for timestamps

Basically, trees can't be write parallelized. So, if a consumer transforms some
stream of input into a tree, the producer should not insert into that tree but
rather some fifo buffer is needed.
