Out of disk space? Could be runaway kernel logs.
$cd /var/log
$du -sh *
-> syslog.1 is 16GB and kern.log.1 is 18GB
Both are filled with the following message over and over:
May 16 11:14:02 maverick-23 kernel: [  920.307876] ramfs42:
/home/faromero/ramfs_modified/kern/inode.c: my_writepage        : 241 :
Write back into tree failed, entry already exists (EEXIST)
which is not surprising, this is our own kernel module code and we were
printing this in a loop due to a crash.

So I wiped the logs specifically with 
$ sudo cp /dev/null syslog.1
$ sudo cp /dev/null kern.log.1

The reason the logs are getting this big is because journalctl is not
configured to limit log sizes, which it probably should be. So, I
modified /etc/systemd/journald.conf and uncommented / set:
SystemMaxFileSize=50M

This should avoid this issue in the future, as kernel debug messages
will just be dropped when the log gets too big.
