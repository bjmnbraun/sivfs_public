SILO is not a product
 - During a transaction, thread observes broken atomicty. Read set validated
 at commit time, but if you have already thrown an assertion error it's too
 late!

 - This is a programmability issue.

How to present SILO as a competitor to our system?

 - Modify the benchmarks to be OK with this. Really only solution since
 SILO's support for getting historical versions is tied to epochs and it
 gets ugly.

 -- Specifically this means have all objects be intra-4K page. 
 -- Have transactions that can tolerate lack of atomicity across objects.
