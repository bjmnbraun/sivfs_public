Make a script that runs all unit tests (concurrently?) and outputs a nice
report

We make some assumptions about integer sizes (type-punning pointers into longs,
visa versa.) Possibly add assertions for these assumptions in some high level
type so that a cross compile will (correctly) fail until we handle these
sorts of things.
