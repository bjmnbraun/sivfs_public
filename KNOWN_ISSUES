Known issues as of 09/08/2017

- Multiple mountpoints of sivfs not yet supported. Attempt to mount the
  filesystem twice sometimes results in a kernel segfault requiring a reboot to
  fix.

- Checkpoint memory space is not reclaimed on file deletion, the file remains
  as a "shadow." Overwriting the file will allow those checkpoint pages to be
  reused. To truly reclaim checkpoint memory space after a large experiment,
  unmount and unlink the kernel module, then relink and remount the filesystem.

  *Helper script mount-me.sh in /kern/ does this.
